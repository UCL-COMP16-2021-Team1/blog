### Week 1

Date: 29/11/2021

On Monday, we provided a list of suggested requirements to our client and Professor Dean:
1. Play in an interactive 3D environment against an AI simulating professional players extracted from tennis match videos.
2. Train a model on tennis game videos and offer live suggestions based on the feed. This acts as a tennis trainer by helping young learners observe techniques and see variations.
3. Determine which sections of a video of a tennis match can be considered a highlight and put them into a highlight reel.
4. Contextually score specific aspects of a tennis match, e.g. positioning, shots, ball trajectory etc. Use for training and entertainment/reference. 

 We agreed upon two main areas of requirements, video classifiers for tennis matches and 3D avatar extraction of the tennis players and proceeded with research of the specifics of each domain. Each team member was allocated one part of the research:
 - Morgane would look into general high-level software architecture and project management;
 - Prithvi would be researching the video classifiers;
 - Jin would investigate the extraction of 3D avatars from video feed.
